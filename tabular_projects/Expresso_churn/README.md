# Expresso Churn Prediction Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Expresso Churn Prediction Challenge! In this competition hosted by Zindi Africa, participants were tasked with developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Expresso customers "churning" â€” becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days. This predictive model aims to assist Expresso in better serving its customers by proactively identifying those at risk of leaving.

## Aim

The primary objective of this challenge is to contribute to the optimization of customer retention strategies at Expresso. By predicting customer churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers, ensuring a positive customer experience and sustained business growth.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Customer Retention:** Identifying customers at risk of churning enables Expresso to implement targeted retention strategies, reducing customer attrition.

- **Resource Optimization:** Proactive measures based on churn predictions allow the company to allocate resources efficiently and focus on retaining high-risk customers.

- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Anticipating and addressing potential churners contributes to an improved overall customer experience.

## Challenge Details

Participants in this Zindi Africa competition worked with data from Expresso, an African telecommunications company. The challenge involved the development of machine learning models capable of predicting customer churn based on various features related to customer transactions and behavior.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Exploring and implementing a variety of classification algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to predict customer churn.

- **Feature Engineering:** Enhancing the predictive power of the model through the creation of relevant features based on transactional and behavioral data.

- **Model Evaluation:** Employing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to assess the performance of the churn prediction models.
