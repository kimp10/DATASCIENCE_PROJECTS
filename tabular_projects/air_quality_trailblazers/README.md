# Predicting Air Quality Challenge

## Overview

**Title:** Predicting Air Quality Challenge

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Predicting Air Quality Challenge hosted on Zindi Africa! In response to the complex relationship between COVID-19, human activity, and air quality, this competition delves into tracking and predicting air quality changes in various locations, especially in African cities. The challenge focuses on leveraging weather data and observations from the Sentinel 5P satellite to predict PM2.5 particulate matter concentration, a key measure of air quality.

**Aim:**
Participants are tasked with developing predictive models to estimate PM2.5 particulate matter concentration every day for each city. The goal is to use satellite and weather data to provide insights into air quality changes, particularly relevant during the current crisis where poor air quality can exacerbate respiratory diseases like COVID-19.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Health and Safety:** Accurate air quality predictions are crucial for assessing the potential health risks associated with poor air quality, especially in the context of respiratory diseases.

- **Environmental Monitoring:** The challenge addresses the need for effective environmental monitoring, providing valuable data on air quality changes across various locations.

- **Global Impact:** The insights gained from the predictive models contribute to a better understanding of the global impact of changes in human activity on air quality.



## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

- **Time Series Analysis:** Implementing time series analysis techniques to capture temporal patterns in air quality data.

- **Satellite Data Processing:** Utilizing tools and libraries for processing and extracting relevant information from Sentinel 5P satellite data.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Exploring and implementing various machine learning algorithms, including regression models, to predict PM2.5 concentrations.
