# Nigeria Insurance Prediction Challenge

## Overview

**Title:** Nigeria Insurance Prediction Challenge

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Nigeria Insurance Prediction Challenge hosted on Zindi Africa! In response to the increase in building collapses in Lagos and major cities in Nigeria, Olusola Insurance Company initiated this challenge. The objective is to build a predictive model that determines the probability of a building having at least one insurance claim during a specified period.

**Aim:**
As the Lead Data Analyst, your task is to develop a predictive model based on building characteristics to assess the likelihood of a building having an insurance claim. The target variable, "Claim," is binary, indicating whether a building has at least one claim (1) or does not have any claim (0) over the insured period.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Risk Mitigation:** Accurate prediction of insurance claims assists in risk assessment and mitigation for Olusola Insurance Company.

- **Customer Protection:** Providing insights into the likelihood of claims helps in offering appropriate coverage to protect customers and their buildings.

- **Operational Efficiency:** A robust predictive model contributes to the efficiency of insurance operations, streamlining the claims processing and management process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Classification Models:** Exploring and implementing various classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of insurance claims.

- **Data Analysis:** Utilizing tools like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data manipulation and analysis.
