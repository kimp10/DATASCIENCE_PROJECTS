# Huawei Fault Impact Analysis Project

## Overview

**Title:** Huawei Fault Impact Analysis Project

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Huawei Fault Impact Analysis Project! In the field of telecom Operation & Maintenance (O&M), fault management plays a crucial role in ensuring stable and reliable networks and services. Specifically, in the Radio Access Network (RAN), fault analysis is a vital component of troubleshooting. Traditional fault analysis methods often rely on predefined rules, but they may not explicitly assess the impact of each fault on network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as coverage and data rate.

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to predict an Network Element's (NE) average data rate change when a fault occurs in the RAN. Leveraging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), participants are tasked with developing models that can predict the impact of faults on RAN KPIs, particularly the average data rate of NEs. This predictive capability is critical for autonomously managing faults, moving from device-centric to service-centric fault management.

## Importance of the Project

- **Service-Centric Fault Management:** ML/AI models predicting fault impact on RAN KPIs enable a shift from fixing network devices to optimizing network service quality.

- **Resource Allocation Optimization:** Predicting fault impact helps optimally allocate limited O&M resources, improving efficiency in addressing critical faults.

- **Stochasticity and Uncertainty Handling:** The project addresses challenges posed by the stochastic nature of RAN and uncertainties related to customer behaviors, non-RAN faults, and complex RAN networking mechanisms.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning/AI:** Utilizing ML and AI algorithms to predict the impact of faults on RAN KPIs, considering the stochastic and complex nature of the RAN.

- **Python:** Implementing models using Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.

- **Data Analysis:** Leveraging tools like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.

## Challenges

- **Uncertainty and Non-Stationarity:** Addressing uncertainties and non-stationarity in fault impact due to stochastic features of RAN, including radio propagation, user mobility, and traffic demand.

- **Complex RAN Networking Mechanisms:** Handling the complexity of RAN networking and mechanisms, considering diverse coupling effects among NEs and the intricate nature of different fault types' mechanisms.

- **Customer Segmentation Uncertainty:** Managing uncertainty arising from distinct user behaviors and requirements, which vary in time and space.

- **Non-RAN Faults:** Addressing uncertainty generated by non-RAN faults, such as flashing transmission issues, devices, and applications.
