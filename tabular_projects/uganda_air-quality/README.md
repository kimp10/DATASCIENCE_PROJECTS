# LayerAI Air Quality Prediction Challenge

## Overview

**Title:** LayerAI Air Quality Prediction Challenge

**Overview:**
Welcome to the LayerAI Air Quality Prediction Challenge hosted on Zindi Africa! AirQo's air quality sensing network, with over 120 low-cost devices deployed across Uganda, regularly monitors and reports on air quality using the PM2.5 measure. In this challenge, the focus is on utilizing satellite radar data from Sentinel 5P to predict air quality in regions in Kampala. The integration of satellite data aims to extend air quality predictions to areas without dedicated sensor devices.

**Aim:**
Your task in this challenge is to predict air quality readings from AirQo's sensors using Sentinel 5P data. The objective is to explore the potential of satellite data in enhancing air quality predictions, especially in regions without direct sensor coverage.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Expanding Predictions:** Integrating satellite data enables the extension of air quality predictions to areas not covered by sensor devices, providing a more comprehensive understanding of air quality.

- **Data Fusion:** Combining satellite radar data with ground-based sensor readings contributes to a more robust and accurate air quality prediction model.

- **Public Health Impact:** Accurate air quality predictions have implications for public health, allowing for timely interventions and awareness in regions prone to poor air quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

- **Satellite Data Processing:** Utilizing tools and libraries for processing and extracting relevant information from Sentinel 5P satellite radar data.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing regression models to predict air quality readings based on both satellite and ground-based sensor data.
