# UmojaHack Africa 2023 Carbon Dioxide Prediction Challenge

## Overview

**Title:** UmojaHack Africa 2023 Carbon Dioxide Prediction Challenge

**Overview:**
Welcome to the UmojaHack Africa 2023 Carbon Dioxide Prediction Challenge! Accurate monitoring of carbon emissions is crucial in the global fight against climate change. While Europe and North America have extensive systems for on-the-ground monitoring, Africa faces challenges in this regard. This competition aims to address the gap by utilizing open-source CO2 emissions data from Sentinel-5P satellite observations to create machine learning or deep learning models for predicting carbon emissions.

**Aim:**
Your task in this challenge is to develop machine learning or deep learning models that leverage Sentinel-5P satellite observations to predict carbon emissions. The solutions generated will enable governments and other stakeholders to estimate carbon emission levels across Africa, particularly in areas where on-the-ground monitoring is not feasible.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Climate Change Mitigation:** Accurate prediction of carbon emissions supports efforts to mitigate climate change by understanding emission patterns and sources.

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Sentinel-5P satellite data enables comprehensive monitoring of carbon emissions, especially in regions with limited on-the-ground monitoring infrastructure.

- **Policy and Planning:** The competition outcomes can inform governments and organizations about carbon emission levels, contributing to informed policy decisions and climate action planning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Utilizing Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning or deep learning models.

- **Satellite Data Processing:** Processing and extracting relevant information from Sentinel-5P satellite observations.

- **Machine Learning or Deep Learning Models:** Implementing algorithms to predict carbon emissions based on satellite data.
