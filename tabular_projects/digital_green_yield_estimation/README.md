# Digital Green Crop Yield Estimate Challenge

## Overview

**Title:** Digital Green Crop Yield Estimate Challenge

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Digital Green Crop Yield Estimate Challenge! Smallholder farmers in India, crucial contributors to global food production, often face challenges related to poverty, malnutrition, and limited access to modern agriculture. Digital Green, through surveys, has collected data providing insights into farming practices, environmental conditions, and crop yields. The goal of this challenge is to leverage machine learning to predict the crop yield per acre for rice or wheat crops in India, aiming to empower smallholder farmers and break the cycle of poverty and malnutrition.

**Objective:**
The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning solution that accurately predicts the crop yield per acre for rice or wheat crops in India. This model has the potential to revolutionize Indian agriculture, serving as a global model for smallholder farmers. Accurate yield predictions empower farmers to make informed decisions on planting and resource allocation, contributing to poverty reduction, improved food security, and adaptive farming practices in the face of climate change.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Empowering Smallholder Farmers:** Accurate yield predictions empower farmers to make informed decisions, improving resource allocation and reducing poverty and malnutrition.

- **Global Model for Smallholder Farmers:** The solutions developed in this challenge have the potential to serve as a model for smallholder farmers globally, advancing sustainable agriculture.

- **Addressing Climate Change Challenges:** Precise yield predictions become increasingly valuable in the face of climate change, supporting adaptive farming practices and ensuring a stable food supply.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms to develop accurate crop yield prediction models.

- **Python:** Implementing models using Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.

- **Data Analysis:** Leveraging tools like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
