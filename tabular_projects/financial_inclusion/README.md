# Financial Inclusion Prediction Challenge

## Overview

**Title:** Financial Inclusion Prediction Challenge

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Financial Inclusion Prediction Challenge! Financial inclusion remains a significant challenge in Africa, hindering economic and human development. In countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, only a small percentage of adults have access to or use commercial bank accounts. Despite the rise of mobile money and innovative fintech solutions, banks continue to play a crucial role in providing access to financial services.

**Aim:**
Your task in this competition is to create a machine learning model that predicts which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. Access to bank accounts is considered a key indicator of financial inclusion, enabling households to save, make payments, and helping businesses build credit-worthiness. The models developed can provide insights into the state of financial inclusion and identify factors influencing individuals' financial security.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Economic Growth:** Access to bank accounts contributes to long-term economic growth by enabling households and businesses to engage in financial transactions and build credit history.

- **Financial Security:** Predictive models help identify key factors driving financial security, offering insights into how financial inclusion can be improved.

- **Policy Impact:** The competition outcomes can inform policymakers about the state of financial inclusion in the region and guide initiatives to enhance access to banking services.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing classification algorithms to predict individuals' likelihood of having or using a bank account.

- **Data Analysis:** Utilizing tools like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
