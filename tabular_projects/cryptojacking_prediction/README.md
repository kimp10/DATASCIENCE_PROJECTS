# Cryptojacking Detection Project

## Overview

**Title:** Cryptojacking Detection Project

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Cryptojacking Detection Project! Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for Ethereum and Bitcoin, involves solving complex puzzles through proof-of-work. However, some malicious actors engage in cryptojacking, a cyberattack where scripts similar to those used in legitimate mining operations are employed to mine cryptocurrency on users' machines without their knowledge. These attacks are stealthy, difficult to detect, and can result in decreased computing speeds and crashes due to the strain on computational resources.

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to classify network activity from various websites as either cryptojacking or not. This classification is based on features derived from both network-based and host-based data. Detecting and classifying cryptojacking activities will contribute to improving cybersecurity by identifying and preventing unauthorized cryptocurrency mining on users' machines.

## Importance of the Project

- **Cybersecurity Enhancement:** Detecting cryptojacking activities helps enhance overall cybersecurity by identifying and preventing illicit cryptocurrency mining.

- **User Protection:** Identifying cryptojacking protects users from decreased computing speeds, crashes, and potential security vulnerabilities associated with unauthorized mining.

- **Resource Optimization:** Preventing cryptojacking ensures that users' computational resources are not misused for malicious purposes, optimizing overall system performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Utilizing Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing classification algorithms to accurately classify network activity as cryptojacking or non-cryptojacking.

- **Data Analysis:** Utilizing tools like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
