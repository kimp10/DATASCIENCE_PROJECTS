## Vehicle Insurance Claim Hackathon
### Overview

Welcome to the Vehicle Insurance Claim Hackathon project! In this data science endeavor, we aim to enhance the efficiency of AutoInland, a West African insurance company focusing on auto insurance. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that anticipates whether a customer is likely to submit a vehicle insurance claim within the next three months.
### Aim

The goal of this project is to streamline AutoInland's financial planning and resource allocation by accurately predicting claims submission. By doing so, the company can enhance its service level standards, ensuring a positive customer experience and high satisfaction levels.
### Importance of the Challenge

    Optimizing Resources: Anticipating future claims requests allows AutoInland to optimize resource allocation efficiently.

    Enhancing Customer Experience: Predictive modeling enables the insurance company to proactively address customer needs, leading to improved satisfaction.

    Financial Planning: Accurate predictions contribute to better financial planning, ensuring the company's stability and growth.

### Challenge Details

Participants in the hackathon are tasked with creating a predictive model capable of determining the likelihood of a customer submitting a vehicle insurance claim in the next three months. The challenge involves working with real-world data and addressing the complexities of predicting human behavior related to insurance claims.
### Technologies Used

    Python: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.

    Machine Learning Libraries: Utilizing popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow for building and training predictive models.

    Data Visualization: Employing tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization, aiding in the interpretation of model results.
